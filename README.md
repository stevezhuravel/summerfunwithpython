This project the most challenging part was connection with the server which i chocice to be horku and travis.io. Travis.io gives me trouble because everythings run untill it said that it failed to deploy but when I go to the page it is up. When i research the error is said maybe to rest api key which i did and it didnt work. It said to check the yamal file to make sure it correct. Different response that said that they got it to work after after either resting the api keys or doing herkou rest.
