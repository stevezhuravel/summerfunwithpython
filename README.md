This project the most challenging part was connection with the server which i chocice to be horku. Travis.io gave me the most trouble because it kept saying that my creditenals were wrong. Then i had to update my api key and than it finally deployed without giving errors. The hardest part of this homework assigment was interacting with travis.io and getting it to work probably and getting it to deploy so that heroku works. Technally you can do this assigment without travis.io but travis.io is used to see if the website build probably and if the deploy was susscssuful or not.
