This project the most challenging part was connection with the server which i chocice to be horku. Travis.io is used to see if every works and it gives me trouble because everythings run untill it said that it failed to deploy but when I go to the my heroku page it is up and running. When i research the error is said maybe to rest api key which i did and it didnt work. It said to check the yml file to make sure it correct which i did and it seems correct. Different response say that they got it to work after after either resting the api keys or doing herkou rest. The error might be with the api key or i might be missing something in my yml file that i m not noticing.
